		<h3>Airport and Flights</h3>
		<p>Travelers should fly into <a href="http://www.flysanjose.com">San Jose International Airport</a> (SJC).  The airport is a 10-minute drive from the Mission.</p>
		<p>Expect to come for dinner on Friday and leave after brunch on Sunday (details will arrive with invitations).  The rest of the long weekend is up to you!</p>
		<h3>Lodging</h3>
		<p>There is a room block at the <a href="http://www.hiltonsantaclara.com/">Hilton Santa Clara</a> for Friday and Saturday night.</p>
		<p>Call 408.330.0001 and push 1 for reservations.  Use the code:SOULT</p>
		<p>The discounted rate is $129 per night + taxes and fees (as long as they have space).</p>
		<p>*Hotel policy note: If you check out prior to the confirmed departure date, they will charge a $150 fee.</p>
		<h4><i>Surrounding Area</i></h4>
		<p>The hotel is located next to Great America and also Levi's Stadium (where the 49ers play).  There won't be a game during the wedding but the <a href="http://www.levisstadium.com/49ers-museum/visit-the-museum/">49ers museum</a> is open from 10-5 most days.</p>
		<p>Check out the <a href="todo.html">SF Bay Area</a> page for more things to do nearby!</p>
		<h3>Transportation</h3>
		<p>A shuttle will be provided between the hotel and events but guests will need to arrange transportation between the airport and hotel.</p>
		<p>Travelers not renting a car at the airport can use the <a href="http://www.flysanjose.com/fl/travelers/ground_trans/Airport_Flyer.html">VTA Airport Flyer</a>.  This free shuttle stops at the Metro Light Rail station (with service to the hotel or downtown San Jose) and the Santa Clara Caltrain station (directly across the street from the Mission).</p>
		<p>To get to the hotel from the airport, use the free VTA Airport Flyer to the Metro/Airport light rail station.  Take the light rail toward Mountain View/Winchester (train 902) and get off at Great America Station.</p>
