		<h2>We don't have a registry</h2>
		<p>We are in the process of moving to California and won't be buying a house for a few years, so we don't have space for things.</p>
		<p>On top of that, Trevor came with a whole house full of things and most of Michelle's are redundant.</p>
		<p>There is not much we need!</p>
		<br/>
		<p>We understand that a lot of people are traveling and it is more important to us that you join us for the wedding.</p>
		<p>If you would really like to get us something, you can contribute to our Honeymoon fund!</p>

		<h3>Nagoya</h3>

		<h3>Osaka</h3>
		<p>Highlight: Tempozan Ferris Wheel</p>
		<p>No honeymoon is complete without the typical anime Ferris Wheel date.  Michelle might be too afraid to ride it but it is impressive to see, at 369 feet tall.  
		It is located at Tempozan harbor next to Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan, which is one of the largest public aquariums in the world.  
		If we get time, we'd also like to see Osaka Castle and the Osaka National Museum of Art.</p>
